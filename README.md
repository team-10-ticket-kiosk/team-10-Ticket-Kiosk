Develop an Object-Oriented Simulator for a Light Rail Ticket Vending Booth 
Single-ride tickets ($3.50), day passes ($10.00), and stored-value cards ($10/$20/$50) are sold at the booth with option of reloads. It accepts specified coins and bills not exceeding $20 plus credit/debit and gives change only in coins, with chutes holding a maximum of 200 coins for each denomination. 
In sales mode, the customers go through a touch-screen mode (with the rate of missing touching at around 3%), payment, and then getting a ticket/card. Overpayment may lead to customer verification if the exact change in coins cannot be given, and stored-value cards take 3 seconds to encode, with jams voiding the transaction and refunding the payment. 
The service mode (maintenance door open) in which operators can replenish coin chutes as well as ticket and card inventories (500 tickets and 100 cards), withdraw funds, change fares, and view and clear logs. Low-stock warning comes for <10% of maximum. 
The simulator will also allow for manual simulation or for arrivals and maintenance schedules to be randomized automatically. Finally, the statistics that have operational significance will also be stored, like refill rate, cash vs. card sales.
